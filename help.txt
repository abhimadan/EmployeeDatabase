---------------------------------------Overview----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The menu bar, located at the top of the window, is split into 3 headings: File, Edit, and Help. 
The File heading containsa Save command and an Exit command; the Edit heading contains an Add 
Employee command and a Search command; and the Help heading contains a Help command and the About 
command. All usage of the database is centred around this menu, as well as the search bar.

Add Employee---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  When this option is selected, it will show a pane with two tabs (see screenshot in full user 
guide). There are two separate forms: one for creating a new part time employee, and one for 
creating a new full time employee, each of which can be accessed through the tabs called 'New Part 
Time Employee' and 'New Full Time Employee'.
  By hovering the mouse over certain fields, it will give instructions on what kind of 
information must be entered into them. For example, the Deductions Rate field must be a percentage
value between 0 and 100. Any of the arrow buttons beside field boxes can be used to adjust the 
numerical value of the fields they are attached to, or a value following the specifications can 
be typed into the box directly. Note: the Generated ID (the employee number) is randomly generated; 
it cannot be changed. If the Add button is clicked and there are any errors in the form, or some 
fields are not filled out, they will be displayed beside the field box which sent the error. 
These fields must be fixed to have appropriated data, after which a message will be displayed that
the employee was successfully added. To clear out all the fields at once, press the Clear button.
  The Add Full Time Employee form is filled out in the same manner, except that the Hourly Wage, 
Hours Per Week, and Weeks Per Year fields are replaced by a single Annual Salary Field. 

Search---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This option in the menu bar is just a redirect to the search bar in the top right corner of the 
screen. Type in an employee number into the system, and the database will display information for
the employee with a matching employee number. The search bar only handles search by employee 
number; any other form of searching is not supported. The database will display a message if the 
employee was not found; otherwise, it will display the information in a panel. 
  Any of the field boxes can be edited (except for Generated ID) with the same specifications as
are required when creating an employee. To modify the employee with the changes, press the Update
button. 
  Viewing an employee also displays their gross annual pay (before deductions) and their net 
annual pay (after deductions) at the bottom of the window. These cannot be edited directly, since
they are calculations made by employee data.
  An employee can also be deleted from the database by pressing the Delete button. They cannot be
restored unless their information is entered in as a new employee, but their employee number will
be different.

Save-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  When this option is selected, the employee information on the database is backed up to a file 
called 'employees.txt'. Do NOT delete this file, or the database will not load when it is started up.

Exit-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This option is an alternative to clicking the close button in the top right corner of the window.
If either this Exit option or the close button is selected, the database automatically backs up.

About----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This option displays a brief background on the creation of this database.
